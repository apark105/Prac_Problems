            Challenge:  
            In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.
            The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time color a...
            Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm.
            You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will output the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.
            The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.
            #Examples:
            s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"
            error_printer(s) => "0/14"
            s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"
            error_printer(s) => "8/22"
            FUNDAMENTALS
        ********************************************************************************/ 
        
        //save the length of the string into a storage space 
        //create a storage space for the valid letters.
        //create a storage space to count up the errors; 
        //For loop: check each letter in the string
            //if it's not within the range of a-m 
                //increase the count
        //piece the number of errors and the length together into a string 

        
        const errorPrinter = (str) => {
            let denominator = str.length; 
            let validLetters = ['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','j','k','l','m'];
            let numerator = 0; 
            let stringify='';
            for (let i=0; i<denominator; i++) {
                let letterPos = validLetters.indexOf(str[i])
                if ( str[i] !== validLetters[letterPos]) {
                    numerator++
                }
            }
            stringify += numerator + '/' + denominator 
            return stringify
        }

        console.log(errorPrinter('aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm'))
