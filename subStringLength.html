    /************************************************** 
        Challenge:
        Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
        Example 1:

        Input: "abcabcbb"
        Output: 3 
        Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
        Example 2:

        Input: "bbbbb"
        Output: 1
        Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
        Example 3:

        Input: "pwwkew"
        Output: 3
        Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
        Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
